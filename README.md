# DBMS_PROJECT

This repo is the implementation of the work done during the IIIrd year Ist sem 2022-23 for our course Database Management Systems.

The system supports the following functionalities:

1. **User Addition:**
   - The Database Administrator (DBA) can add users to the database with the necessary privileges.

2. **Property Management:**
   - Both the DBA and Manager have the capability to add, delete, and update any property record.

3. **Owner Property Management:**
   - Owners are allowed to add, delete, and update records for their own properties exclusively.

4. **Rental Information:**
   - Admins and Managers can add rental details for properties once they are rented by tenants.

5. **Rent History Report:**
   - The system can generate a report on the rental history of a specific property.

6. **Property Search:**
   - Users can check the availability of properties for rent within a given city, locality, or price range.

7. **Property Status Check:**
   - Users, regardless of role, can check the status of a property based on its ID.

8. **Tenant Access:**
   - Tenants are restricted from inserting, deleting, or modifying any data in the tables. They can only view available properties for rent.
